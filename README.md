Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project facilitates driver education by offering online classes, practice tests, and on-road lessons. DriverPass seeks a cloud-based system that lets users download reports, reset passwords, block accounts, and track reservations and cancellations. Customers, when purchasing a package, must provide credit card information to access training and can select from three different training packages. Additionally, the system will maintain notes on driver performance to highlight those who excel and those who may need further assistance. The DriverPass system must also be connected to the DMV system so that DriverPass provides customers with the most current information.
