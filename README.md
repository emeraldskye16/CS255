Briefly summarize the DriverPass project? Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project facilitates driver education by offering online classes, practice tests, and on-road lessons. DriverPass seeks a cloud-based system that lets users download reports, reset passwords, block accounts, and track reservations and cancellations. Customers, when purchasing a package, must provide credit card information to access training and can select from three different training packages. Additionally, the system will maintain notes on driver performance to highlight those who excel and those who may need further assistance. The DriverPass system must also be connected to the DMV system so that DriverPass provides customers with the most current information. 

What did you do particularly well?

This course has helped me better understand how to analyze systems and visually represent abstract concepts. The diagrams I created to illustrate classes, activities, sequences, and data flow clarified my work, and I believe I executed them well.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revisrove it?

After looking at my documents, I could make my UML Use Case Diagram more straightforward. While it shows all the pieces needed, it also has many overlapping lines and use cases that could be distributed to make it easier to read. Making it so that an outsider could easily follow along. 

How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

I interpreted and implemented the users' needs into my system design by carefully analyzing the insights from the DriverPass Interview. I documented their requirements and created charts and diagrams to visualize users' needs. This approach allowed me to craft a design that accurately reflected likely user interactions. For instance, I developed class diagrams informed by the sequence and activity diagrams, anticipating how each class would be utilized in practice. 

Considering the user's needs is crucial in system design because it ensures that the final product aligns with the customer's wants. If these needs are overlooked, the system design can become too abstract and may fail to provide practical solutions to the problems it's intended to solve. Ultimately, a design that prioritizes the user's needs leads to a more effective and satisfactory outcome for all stakeholders involved.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

There are many ways to design software that will hopefully lead to similar results. The best place to start is with an understanding of client requirements. Once the clientâ€™s requirements (wants and needs) are down on paper, you can begin working on prototypes, functional and non-functional requirements, and design. In DriverPass, an iterative design approach would be one of the least complex design methods, as many components must be reviewed relatively quickly.
